The variance of a single coin flip will be the probability that the success happens times
the probability that it does not happen: p·(1-p), or 0.5 x 0.5.
Because we have n = 10 number of coin flips, the variance of a single fair coin flip is
multiplied by the number of flips. Thus we get the equation:

 Variance(#ofHeads)=Var(X)=n×p×(1−p)
 Variance(#ofHeads)=10×0.5×(1−0.5)=2.5​​
A certain basketball player has an 85% chance of making a given free throw.
Uncomment variance_baskets and set it equal to the variance of free throws made from 20 shots.

Let’s say a student has a 98% chance of arriving on time to class.
Uncomment variance_late and set it equal to the variance of days the student will arrive
late to class throughout the 180 school days in a school year.

variance_late = 180 * 0.02 * (1-0.02)
